<p>In different fields of science it is often discussed the right tools to have certain jobs done. On this matter, it is common to have a little friendly arguments on “why R is better for this” or “how Python excels on this other thing”. In the end, the best tool is the one you know and feel more comfortable to work with.</p>
<p>Regarding Python and R, both are programming languages and have more things in common than differences. In my opinion, choosing one tool over the other is a matter of preference.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>
<p>As read in <span class="citation"><span>“Python Vs. R: What’s the Difference?”</span> (<a href="#ref-ibm" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> describes Python as a “general-purpose, object-oriented programming language… easy to learn and a favorite of programmers and developers”.</p>
<p><span class="citation"><span>“Python Vs r: Know the Difference”</span> (<a href="#ref-inter" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> exposes several advantages of using Python:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Versatility</em>: The language is one of the most versatile ones. It is neat, uncomplicated to use, and well structured.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Open Source</em>: Python can be downloaded easily. It has one of the most active supporting forums, and anyone can contribute to improving the libraries and their functionalities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Libraries</em>: Python has many libraries that are necessary to carry out major data science-related functions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Productivity</em>: Its integration and control capabilities enhance and save a lot of time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Embeddable</em>: Python codes are embeddable. Python codes can be integrated with other programming languages like C++.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>R</h2>
<p>On the other hand, R is a programming language that’s optimized for statistical analysis and data visualization. It was built with a rich ecosystem with complex data models and elegant tools for data reporting (<span class="citation"><span>“Python Vs. R: What’s the Difference?”</span> (<a href="#ref-ibm" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>It is easy to identify the benefits of working with R. <span class="citation"><span>“Python Vs r: Know the Difference”</span> (<a href="#ref-inter" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> listed some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Open Source</em>: R is an open-source language and is free to download and use. One can also contribute by optimizing its source code.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Platform independent</em>: R is platform-independent and can work on all the operating systems like UNIX, Windows, and Mac.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Wrangling</em>: Through its packages like readr and dplyr, R has the capability of converting a messy code into a structured one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Plots and Graphs</em>: Through ggplot and plotly, R creates attractive graphs with notations and formulas.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Package Availability</em>: R has numerous packages dedicated to the development of machine learning, data analysis, and statistical projects.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Differences</h2>
<p>Python and R are the preferred languages in many fields of science. They are both open source programs, and relatively easy to learn.</p>
<p>Python is generally used in Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and others, while R is mostly focused in statistical part of a project. R is a powerful tool for visualizing data in the form of graphs.</p>

<div id="in-sum" class="section level2">
<h2>In sum</h2>
<p>In this site, we will be using R, but we are not discarting using Python sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>Both languages are similar, so we invite the reader to choose one and start working.</p>
