In different fields of science it is often discussed the right tools to have certain jobs done. On this matter, it is common to have a little friendly arguments on "why R is better for this" or "how Python excels on this other thing". In the end, the best tool is the one you know and feel more comfortable to work with.

Regarding Python and R, both are programming languages and have more things in common than differences. In my opinion, choosing one tool over the other is a matter of preference.

## Python
As read in @ibm describes Python as a "general-purpose, object-oriented programming language... easy to learn and a favorite of programmers and developers".

@inter exposes several advantages of using Python:

- *Versatility*: The language is one of the most versatile ones. It is neat, uncomplicated to use, and well structured.

- *Open Source*: Python can be downloaded easily. It has one of the most active supporting forums, and anyone can contribute to improving the libraries and their functionalities.

- *Libraries*: Python has many libraries that are necessary to carry out major data science-related functions.

- *Productivity*: Its integration and control capabilities enhance and save a lot of time.

- *Embeddable*: Python codes are embeddable. Python codes can be integrated with other programming languages like C++.

## R
On the other hand, R is a programming language thatâ€™s optimized for statistical analysis and data visualization. It was built with a rich ecosystem with complex data models and elegant tools for data reporting (@ibm).

It is easy to identify the benefits of working with R. @inter listed some of them:

- *Open Source*: R is an open-source language and is free to download and use. One can also contribute by optimizing its source code.

- *Platform independent*: R is platform-independent and can work on all the operating systems like UNIX, Windows, and Mac.

- *Data Wrangling*: Through its packages like readr and dplyr, R has the capability of converting a messy code into a structured one.

- *Plots and Graphs*: Through ggplot and plotly, R creates attractive graphs with notations and formulas.

- *Package Availability*: R has numerous packages dedicated to the development of machine learning, data analysis, and statistical projects.

## Key Differences
Python and R are the preferred languages in many fields of science. They are both open source programs, and relatively easy to learn.

Python is generally used in Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and others, while R is mostly focused in statistical part of a project. R is a powerful tool for visualizing data in the form of graphs.

## In sum
In this site, we will be using R, but we are not discarting using Python sometime in the near future.

Both languages are similar, so we invite the reader to choose one and start working.
