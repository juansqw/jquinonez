R is a programming language thatâ€™s optimized for statistical analysis and data visualization. It is used with RStudio, a very common IDE for R that is transitioning to [Posit](https://posit.co) a new developing tool that support several other programming languages (such as Python, similar to VC Studio). Although this might be obsolete in a few months, we will show how to install RStudio in the first section and comment the general environment on the section one. Following these sections we'll cover the basics of some of the most common R objects and how to work with them using just base functions.

## Installation Guide
A very detailed guide showing the steps to install R and RStudio can be found in [TechVidvan](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/install-r/) website. In general terms, one has to choose the R version according to one's operative system and then download [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
