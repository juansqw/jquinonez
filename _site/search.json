    "text": "Recently I’ve been working on Shiny Apps developing dashboards and other kinds of visualizations. I was able to develop this dashboard using data from the CMCA database. This dashboard summarizes the information of some countries.\n\n\n\nLatin America Dashboard\n\n\nI used this project to practice using Shiny modules to create graphs and realized that I need to work on my CSS abilities. Even though I know how to use CSS, it is very challenging for me to define how i would like things to look like, so it’s almost impossible to come up with some “good-looking” designs.\nSomething else that I learned with this project was that I could use functions to reduce writing (and the probability of making a typing mistake). For example, in the UI section of the app, I had to write the same code for each country. Instead of this one can write a function containing how one country should look like and then pass it to a list of countries."

    "text": "I recently finished reading Morgan Housel “The Psychology of Money” and here I share my thoughts and impressions of this book.\nI liked this book because it showed that what we think of money is not as black and white as we think. We tend to judge people that go bankrupt right after receiving a huge amount of money (from inheritance or winning the lottery), and people that spend most of their life saving money and living precariously. Housel explain each behavior as the result of what each individual experienced in their lives.\nThis post will summarize this reading and will highlight some of the concepts that got my attention."

In recent years, the literature is pointing out that not only inflation trajectory is important, but also the uncertainty that surrounds inflation projections.\nHall and Mitchell (2007) and other authors (Rossi (2014)) propose the use of fancharts to show the central path of forecast, but also the uncertainty of these projections (on shaded areas).\nIn this document, my dear friend Nerys and I use a normal density function, with asymmetry and changing variance in time to obtain the density of the inflation forecast and the uncertainty related to the historic forecast error on different horizons."
