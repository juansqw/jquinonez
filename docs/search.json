    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since countries have adopted the Inflation Targeting Scheme for monetary policy, inflation and inflation forecast has played a central role for central banks. In recent years, the literature is pointing out that not only inflation trajectory is important, but also the uncertainty that surrounds inflation projections.\nHall and Mitchell (2007) and other authors (Rossi (2014)) propose the use of fancharts to show the central path of forecast, but also the uncertainty of these projections (on shaded areas).\nIn this document, my dear friend Nerys and I use a normal density function, with asymmetry and changing variance in time to obtain the density of the inflation forecast and the uncertainty related to the historic forecast error on different horizons."

    "text": "Recently I’ve been working on Shiny Apps developing dashboards and other kinds of visualizations. I was able to develop this dashboard using data from the CMCA database. This dashboard summarizes the information of some countries.\n\n\n\nLatin America Dashboard\n\n\nI used this project to practice using Shiny modules to create graphs and realized that I need to work on my CSS abilities. Even though I know how to use CSS, it is very challenging for me to define how i would like things to look like, so it’s almost impossible to come up with some “good-looking” designs.\nSomething else that I learned with this project was that I could use functions to reduce writing (and the probability of making a typing mistake). For example, in the UI section of the app, I had to write the same code for each country. Instead of this one can write a function containing how one country should look like and then pass it to a list of countries."

    "text": "Inflation is a generalized increase in prices, measured from the relative variations of the price indexes of the products in a representative basket. This indicator is used to update contracts and make projections by agents in the economy.\nThis document (Quinonez and Ramirez 2021) presents one of the main short-term inflation forecasting methodologies used by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD), showing in detail the forecasting process.\nThe development of these price projections for each item of the basket of goods and services, in general, consists of the following steps:\nAfter this, the projection of each item is added using the weights of each one, thus obtaining a short-term inflation projection."

    "title": "The Importance of a Credit Score",
    "section": "",
    "text": "However, companies do not always have complete information about customers, so they cannot perfectly discriminate between good customers and bad customers. This puts companies on the downside of adverse selection in this type of business.\nCredit scores opportunistically seek to correct the adverse selection problems of these entities by summarizing a set of customer characteristics into a score. The central idea of these scales is to score customers according to a set of characteristics and to identify those attributes inherent in good and bad customers. Bessis (2015) defines credit ratings as assessments of the credit standing of borrowers and are excellent tools that best discriminate between defaulters and non-defaulters. The use of credit scores offers an objective way to assess risk, and it is also a consistent approach (Siddiqi 2006) that can be applied to a great number of potential customers in a relative simple procedure (thanks to the technological advances in recent years).\nOn the other hand, clients seek to improve their scores by making various modifications to their financial behavior (paying debts in arrears, or improving their use of revolving credit, among others), so that companies will offer their services to them.\nOnce selected, clients can negotiate additional services or lower prices, given their score level, i.e. clients of a commercial bank with a better credit score can receive preferential lending rates.\n\n\nTable 1: Credit Score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nNumber of Good Clients\nCumulative Number of Good Clients\nNumber of Bad Clients\nCumulative Number of Bad Clients\n\n\n\n\n175 - 200\n115\n115\n10\n10\n\n\n150 - 174\n105\n220\n20\n30\n\n\n125 - 149\n95\n315\n30\n60\n\n\n100 - 124\n85\n400\n40\n100\n\n\n75 - 99\n75\n475\n50\n150\n\n\n50 - 74\n65\n540\n60\n210\n\n\n0 - 49\n55\n595\n70\n280\n\n\n\n\nAuthor’s elaboration\nTable 1 shows an example of a credit score and the cumulative number of good and bad clients. Using this information businesses may choose to serve only clients with credit scores above 125. This would mean that they will serve 375 clients, 315 will be good clients and 60 will be bad clients, which implies that, given the cut-off score, 16% of the clients may be bad clients. Low cut-off score will increase the potential clients, but will also increase the chance of getting bad clients.\nThis table also shows that for every score, there are good and also bad clients. As a business standard, businesses set a score range in which expert analysis is needed to make a decision. Credit ratings, in sum, are a mix of qualitative and quantitative criteria used to assess the potential clients, but should also expert analysis at the end of the decision process.\nCredit scores help asses client creditworthiness, and also allows clients to access better pricing for services.\nHow are credit scores calibrated? Which characteristics influence in this scale? These, and more questions are soon to be answered in latter posts.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBessis, Joël. 2015. “Risk Management in Banking.”\n\n\nSiddiqi, Nadim. 2006. “Credit Risk Scorecards: Developing and Implementing Intelligent Credit Scoring.”\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{díaztavera2022,\n  author = {César Díaz Tavera and Juan Quiñonez Wu},\n  title = {The {Importance} of a {Credit} {Score}},\n  date = {2022-09-07},\n  url = {https://cesardt97.github.io/Blog/posts/series-sc/intro-to-the-study-serie/09-05-2022_intro_study_serie.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nCésar Díaz Tavera, and Juan Quiñonez Wu. 2022. “The Importance of\na Credit Score.” September 7, 2022. https://cesardt97.github.io/Blog/posts/series-sc/intro-to-the-study-serie/09-05-2022_intro_study_serie.html."
